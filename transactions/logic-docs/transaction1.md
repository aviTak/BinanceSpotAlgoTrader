### **Understanding the Logic and Reasoning Behind the Conditions and Set Selection**

Let's break down the logic of the code, focusing on why the conditions are set the way they are, why certain sets are chosen, and what happens if the conditions are not met.

### **Context Overview**
In this code, the trading logic is determining whether to use "Set A" or "Set B" based on the calculated values from `formula1` and `formula2`, compared against a `condition`. Each set represents a sequence of trades involving specific cryptocurrency pairs, and choosing the correct set is crucial for maximizing profitability or minimizing risk.

### **Formulas and Conditions**
1. **Formula 1**: 
   - **`formula1 = (bidArray[2] / marketArray[1] / askArray[0] - 1)`**
   - This formula evaluates the potential profitability of a trading sequence involving three assets.

2. **Formula 2**:
   - **`formula2 = marketArray[1] * bidArray[0] / askArray[2] - 1`**
   - This formula evaluates the potential profitability of a different trading sequence involving the same three assets but in a different order.

3. **Condition**:
   - **`condition = parseFloat(0.11 / 122)`**
   - This condition represents a threshold that either formula must exceed to be considered a viable trading opportunity.

### **Sets Overview**
- **Set A**:
  - Sequence: `{ symbol: "BTCFDUSD", side: "BUY" }`, `{ symbol: "DOGEBTC", side: "BUY" }`, `{ symbol: "DOGEFDUSD", side: "SELL" }`
  - This set represents buying BTC with FDUSD, then buying DOGE with BTC, and finally selling DOGE for FDUSD.

- **Set B**:
  - Sequence: `{ symbol: "DOGEFDUSD", side: "BUY" }`, `{ symbol: "DOGEBTC", side: "SELL" }`, `{ symbol: "BTCFDUSD", side: "SELL" }`
  - This set represents buying DOGE with FDUSD, then selling DOGE for BTC, and finally selling BTC for FDUSD.

### **Logic Explanation**
1. **First Condition (`if (formula2 < formula1 && formula1 >= condition)`)**:
   - **Logic**: If `formula1` indicates a higher profitability than `formula2` and `formula1` meets the minimum threshold defined by `condition`, then "Set A" is selected.
   - **Reasoning**: 
     - **Higher Profitability**: Since `formula1` is greater, the trading sequence represented by "Set A" is more profitable. This means the combination of buying BTC with FDUSD, converting it to DOGE, and then selling DOGE back to FDUSD yields the highest return.
     - **Meets Condition**: The profitability indicated by `formula1` meets or exceeds the threshold, making "Set A" a viable strategy.

   - **Action**: 
     - **Select Set A**: The system chooses "Set A" because it is more profitable under current market conditions.
     - **Initialize Quantity**: The initial quantity for the trades is set based on the values defined in "Set A".

2. **Second Condition (`else if (formula1 < formula2 && formula2 >= condition)`)**:
   - **Logic**: If `formula2` is more profitable than `formula1` and `formula2` meets the condition, then "Set B" is selected.
   - **Reasoning**:
     - **Higher Profitability**: Here, "Set B" yields a higher return, making it the preferred sequence. This means buying DOGE with FDUSD, converting DOGE to BTC, and then selling BTC for FDUSD is more profitable.
     - **Meets Condition**: The profitability indicated by `formula2` is above the threshold, making "Set B" a viable strategy.

   - **Action**: 
     - **Select Set B**: The system opts for "Set B" because it offers higher profitability based on the current market conditions.
     - **Initialize Quantity**: The initial quantity for the trades is set according to the values defined in "Set B".

3. **Final Condition (`else`)**:
   - **Logic**: If neither formula produces a result that meets or exceeds the condition, no set is chosen, and the process is terminated.
   - **Reasoning**:
     - **Lack of Viable Opportunities**: If both formulas result in values below the condition, neither trading sequence is profitable enough to justify executing the trades. This prevents the system from engaging in unprofitable or risky trades.
     - **Risk Management**: By not selecting any set, the system avoids making a trade that could lead to losses.

   - **Action**:
     - **Terminate the Process**: The system logs that the conditions were not met and ends the subprocess, marking it as "REJECTED_CONDITION". No trades are executed in this scenario, effectively mitigating potential risks.

### **Summary and Reasoning**
- **Why Set A is Chosen in the First `if` Statement**:
  - **Set A** is chosen when `formula1` is greater than `formula2` and meets the profitability threshold (`condition`). This indicates that the trading path involving buying BTC with FDUSD, then converting to DOGE, and finally selling DOGE for FDUSD is the most profitable and viable option under current market conditions.

- **Why Set B is Chosen in the `else if` Statement**:
  - **Set B** is selected when `formula2` outperforms `formula1` and also meets the profitability threshold. This suggests that the sequence of buying DOGE with FDUSD, converting to BTC, and selling BTC for FDUSD is more profitable.

- **Why No Action is Taken in the `else` Statement**:
  - If neither formula produces a sufficiently profitable result, executing any trade would not be wise. Therefore, the system terminates the process without selecting any set, avoiding potential losses.

### **Final Takeaway**
- The logic ensures that the system only executes trades when there is a clear and viable profit opportunity. By comparing `formula1` and `formula2` against each other and the profitability threshold (`condition`), the system dynamically selects the most profitable trading sequence or refrains from trading if the conditions aren't favorable. This approach optimizes trading outcomes while managing risks effectively.
