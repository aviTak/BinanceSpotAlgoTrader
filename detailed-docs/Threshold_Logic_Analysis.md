Given the formulas and the conditions used in Transaction 1 and Transaction 2, we can better understand the client's approach and the significance of the condition value `0.105/122` or `0.1/122`.

### **Understanding the Condition Value:**
- **0.11/122** or **0.1/122** is approximately equal to `0.00090163934` or `0.00081967213` respectively.
- This small value likely represents a minimum profitability threshold or margin that the client wants to ensure before proceeding with a trade. It serves as a benchmark to decide whether a trade is worth executing based on the calculated formulas.

### **Formulas in Transactions 1 and 2:**
- **Transaction 1:**
  - **formula1:** \(\frac{\text{bidArray[2]}}{\text{marketArray[1]}} / \text{askArray[0]} - 1\)
  - **formula2:** \(\text{marketArray[1]} \times \text{bidArray[0]} / \text{askArray[2]} - 1\)
  - **condition:** \( \text{condition} = \text{parseFloat(0.11/122)} \)
  - The condition checks if `formula1` is greater than or equal to this threshold and if `formula2` is less than `formula1`.

- **Transaction 2:**
  - **formula1:** \(\frac{\text{bidArray[2]}}{\text{transactionDetail.transactions[0].executedPrice}} / \text{transactionDetail.transactions[1].marketPrice} - 1\)
  - **formula2:** \(\text{bidArray[0]} \times \text{transactionDetail.transactions[1].marketPrice} / \text{transactionDetail.transactions[0].executedPrice} - 1\)
  - **formula3:** \(\frac{\text{bidArray[2]}}{\text{transactionDetail.transactions[0].executedPrice}} / \text{bidArray[1]} - 1\)
  - **formula4:** \(\text{bidArray[0]} \times \text{askArray[1]} / \text{transactionDetail.transactions[0].executedPrice} - 1\)
  - **condition:** The threshold used here is `parseFloat(0.105/122)`.

### **Interpretation:**
- **Profitability Check:**
  - The client is likely using these formulas to ensure that the potential trade will result in a profit or, at the very least, not a loss.
  - The condition `0.00090163934` or `0.00081967213` acts as a baseline for this profitability check. If the calculated formula exceeds this value, the trade is considered acceptable.

### **Application in Transaction 3:**
Given that Transaction 3 also involves calculating a breakeven price and deciding whether to place a limit order based on current market conditions, the client might use a similar threshold condition to decide whether to proceed with the trade.

**Condition Calculation in Transaction 3:**
- **Condition:**
  - The client might calculate a similar ratio comparing the current ask price and the calculated breakeven price.
  - If the ratio meets or exceeds the threshold (e.g., `0.00090163934` or `0.00081967213`), the trade is executed.

  \[
  \text{Condition} = \left(\frac{\text{Current Ask Price} - \text{Calculated Price}}{\text{Calculated Price}}\right) \geq \text{Threshold Value}
  \]

### **Conclusion:**
- The number `0.00090163934` or `0.00081967213` appears to be a consistent threshold the client uses across transactions to ensure a minimal acceptable profit margin.
- This small value likely reflects a very conservative trading strategy, aiming to capture even the smallest profitable trades while minimizing risk.
- This threshold would likely apply in Transaction 3 as well, determining whether the trade meets the minimal profitability criteria before execution.

### **Final Documentation for Transaction 3:**

**Purpose:**
To avoid losses and ensure a minimal profit during the third transaction, where DOGE is sold for FDUSD, using the executed prices from Transactions 1 and 2.

**Condition Calculation:**
- The condition checks if the profitability ratio between the current ask price and the calculated breakeven price meets or exceeds a predefined threshold (likely `0.00090163934` or `0.00081967213`).

  \[
  \text{Condition} = \left(\frac{\text{Current Ask Price} - \text{Calculated Price}}{\text{Calculated Price}}\right) \geq \text{Threshold Value}
  \]

- **Implementation:**
  - If true, place a limit order at the current ask price.
  - If false, adjust the order price based on the calculated price and current market conditions.

This ensures that Transaction 3 is executed only when it meets the client's conservative profitability requirements.
