Let's break down the logic, reasoning, and formulas used in `transaction2`. This will help clarify why certain decisions are made, why certain conditions are checked, and how the trading logic operates with respect to the specific symbols and trading strategies.

### **Transaction 2 Breakdown**

#### **Context Overview**
In this trading strategy, `transaction2` is part of a sequence that determines whether to proceed with a market order, a bid/ask price order, or to cancel the order and reverse the previous transaction. The goal is to ensure that each trade is executed under optimal conditions to maximize profitability or minimize losses.

### **Symbols Overview**
- **`BTCFDUSD`**: Buy BTC using FDUSD.
- **`DOGEBTC`**: Buy DOGE using BTC.
- **`DOGEFDUSD`**: Sell DOGE for FDUSD.

These symbols represent the trading pairs used in the strategy. The specific trades involve buying and selling these assets in sequence.

### **Formulas Explained**

1. **`formula1 = bidArray[2] / parseFloat(transactionDetail.transactions[0].executedPrice) / parseFloat(transactionDetail.transactions[1].marketPrice) - 1`**
   - **Explanation**:
     - This formula calculates the relative profitability of selling DOGE for FDUSD (`bidArray[2]`) after acquiring BTC with FDUSD (`transactionDetail.transactions[0].executedPrice`) and DOGE with BTC (`transactionDetail.transactions[1].marketPrice`).
   - **Human-readable format**:
     - **Profitability (Formula 1) = (Bid Price of DOGEFDUSD) / (Executed Price of BTCFDUSD) / (Market Price of DOGEBTC) - 1**

   - **Reasoning**:
     - This formula helps assess whether the trading sequence starting with buying BTC and ending with selling DOGE for FDUSD is profitable. A positive result indicates potential profit.

2. **`formula2 = bidArray[0] * parseFloat(transactionDetail.transactions[1].marketPrice) / parseFloat(transactionDetail.transactions[0].executedPrice) - 1`**
   - **Explanation**:
     - This formula calculates the relative profitability of selling DOGEBTC (`bidArray[0]`) after buying BTC with FDUSD and DOGE with BTC.
   - **Human-readable format**:
     - **Profitability (Formula 2) = (Bid Price of DOGEBTC) * (Market Price of DOGEBTC) / (Executed Price of BTCFDUSD) - 1**

   - **Reasoning**:
     - This formula evaluates whether selling DOGE for BTC and then converting BTC back to FDUSD is profitable. A positive result indicates potential profit.

3. **`formula3 = bidArray[2] / parseFloat(transactionDetail.transactions[0].executedPrice) / bidArray[1] - 1`**
   - **Explanation**:
     - This formula calculates the relative profitability of selling DOGEFDUSD (`bidArray[2]`) after acquiring BTC with FDUSD and then converting DOGE back to BTC (`bidArray[1]`).
   - **Human-readable format**:
     - **Profitability (Formula 3) = (Bid Price of DOGEFDUSD) / (Executed Price of BTCFDUSD) / (Bid Price of DOGEBTC) - 1**

   - **Reasoning**:
     - This formula assesses the profitability of a sequence that involves buying BTC, converting it to DOGE, and then converting DOGE back to FDUSD. A positive result indicates potential profit.

4. **`formula4 = bidArray[0] * askArray[1] / parseFloat(transactionDetail.transactions[0].executedPrice) - 1`**
   - **Explanation**:
     - This formula calculates the relative profitability of selling DOGEBTC (`bidArray[0]`) after buying DOGEBTC at the ask price (`askArray[1]`) and converting BTC to FDUSD.
   - **Human-readable format**:
     - **Profitability (Formula 4) = (Bid Price of DOGEBTC) * (Ask Price of DOGEBTC) / (Executed Price of BTCFDUSD) - 1**

   - **Reasoning**:
     - This formula evaluates the profitability of buying DOGE with BTC, selling DOGE for FDUSD, and converting FDUSD back to BTC. A positive result indicates potential profit.

5. **`formula5 = parseFloat(0.1 / 122)`**
   - **Explanation**:
     - This formula calculates a threshold value, which could represent a minimum profitability or spread required for a trade to be considered viable.
   - **Human-readable format**:
     - **Condition = 0.1 / 122**

   - **Reasoning**:
     - This value serves as a benchmark. Only if the profitability indicated by one of the other formulas exceeds this threshold will the trade be considered for execution.

### **Conditions and Logic**
The key part of the logic is the conditional block that determines whether to proceed with the trade or reverse the previous transaction.

1. **Check Condition**:
   - **`condition = isMarketPrice ? (side === SIDE.BUY ? formula1 >= formula5 : formula2 >= formula5) : (side === SIDE.BUY ? formula3 >= formula5 : formula4 >= formula5)`**
   - **Explanation**:
     - Depending on whether the trade is being placed at the market price or the bid/ask price, and depending on whether the trade is a buy or sell, the system checks if the appropriate formula meets or exceeds the threshold defined by `formula5`.
   - **Reasoning**:
     - This ensures that only trades with potential profitability above a certain threshold are executed, minimizing the risk of unprofitable trades.

2. **If Condition is Met**:
   - **Proceed with Trade**:
     - If the condition is met, the system progresses with the trade, either checking the order status in a loop or placing the order at the market or bid/ask price.
     - **Logics Involved**:
       - **`updateAllPrices`**: Updates transaction details with the latest prices.
       - **`getOrderInfo`**: Retrieves the necessary information to place the order.
       - **`executeOrder`**: Places the order with the exchange.
       - **`updateTransactionDetail`**: Updates transaction details with the results of the order.

   - **Why Proceed?**:
     - The condition being met indicates that the trade is likely to be profitable. Proceeding ensures the system capitalizes on this opportunity.

3. **If Condition is Not Met**:
   - **Reverse Transaction**:
     - If the condition is not met, the system reverses the previous transaction by calling `reverseTransaction1`.
   - **Reasoning**:
     - Reversing the transaction is a safeguard to avoid losses. By reversing the trade, the system returns to a previous state, effectively mitigating any potential negative impact from an unprofitable trade.

### **Summary**
- **Formulas**:
  - Each formula calculates the potential profitability of a specific sequence of trades, involving different combinations of buying and selling assets. These formulas help determine the best course of action.

- **Conditions**:
  - Conditions ensure that only trades with potential profitability above a set threshold are executed. This helps optimize the trading strategy for maximum gain while minimizing risks.

- **Logic**:
  - The system uses the calculated formulas and conditions to decide whether to proceed with a trade, place an order, or reverse the previous transaction. This dynamic approach allows the system to adapt to real-time market conditions and execute the most profitable strategy available.

This detailed explanation should help you understand how `transaction2` operates, the reasoning behind each decision, and how the trading strategy is designed to maximize profitability while managing risk effectively.
